I am a developer working in web, mobile, and AR/VR experiences and applications. Based in NYC, I've worked for tech startups developing web applications for social media analytics, healthcare, and logistics. I am passionate about how technology can improve life, and in particular I believe ubiquitous mixed reality is a new frontier of human-computer interaction that must be thoughtfully made. My goal with this site is to share my excitement with those who want to share in that work.
