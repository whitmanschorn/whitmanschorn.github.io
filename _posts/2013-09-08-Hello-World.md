Hello, World

I'm Whitman Schorn and this is my website. It's a place for frontend code, games, and whatever else I feel like posting. If you don't know, I'm a graduate of [Oberlin](http://cs.oberlin.edu/) who is now living in [Manhattan](http://media.giphy.com/media/Nfc8nCmlpEXZu/giphy.gif) and working at [Bitly](https://bitly.com/pages/about).

## This Site

Well, I'm at least competent enough to make a site to lie about those previous things, right?

So far: npm + Jekyll + Logom theme + github-pages
Coming soon: Coffeescript + Backbone + [crtdg](http://crtrdg.com/) + Handlebars + NoSQL + ?
