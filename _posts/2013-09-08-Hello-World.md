Hello, World

I'm Whitman Schorn and this is my website. It's a place for frontend code, games, and whatever else I feel like posting. If you don't know, I'm a graduate of [Oberlin](http://cs.oberlin.edu/) who is now living in [Manhattan](http://media.giphy.com/media/Nfc8nCmlpEXZu/giphy.gif) and working at [Bitly](https://bitly.com/pages/about).

[This game](http://globalgamejam.org/2013/ping) was my team's entry at the Global Game Jam 2013, San Francisco (Awards included best 3d graphics, and best audio). It's an atmospheric adventure game with aural stealth mechanics and dynamic animation. Built with Unity3D and plugins including Mixamo.  Play it [here](http://techiealex.com/ggj13/ping.html).

### &#9786; This Site

This site should serve as a partial demonstration of my tastes and skills in basic frontendery. More abstract math or literary references may creep in, you've been warned. 

So far: npm + Jekyll + Logom theme + github-pages
Coming soon: Coffeescript + Backbone + [crtdg](http://crtrdg.com/) + Handlebars + NoSQL + ?
