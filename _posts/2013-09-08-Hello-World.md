Hello, World

I'm Whitman Schorn and this is my website. It's a place for frontend code, games, and whatever else I feel like posting. If you don't know, I'm a graduate of [Oberlin](http://cs.oberlin.edu/) who is now living in [Manhattan](http://media.giphy.com/media/Nfc8nCmlpEXZu/giphy.gif) and working at [Bitly](https://bitly.com/pages/about). 

Cheers,

-Whit
