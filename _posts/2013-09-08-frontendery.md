# What is 'frontendery'?

 *Frontendery* __(n.)__ is a word I've heard used (and/or just made up), to refer to any part of a broad range of skills, from design, typography, and composition all the way to webpage coding to complex algorithms. Anything resulting in the satisfactory arrangement of pixels on screens. It doesn't refer to a 'full stack' of skills, however, rather it implies more of a polymath-like dabbling and excitement in the man open areas in which one might excel. There are more and better technologies coming together every day, so let the frontendery begin!
