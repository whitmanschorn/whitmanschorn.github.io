# What is 'frontendery'?

 *Frontendery* __(n.)__ is a word I've heard used (and/or just made up), to refer to any part of a broad range of skills, from design, typography, and composition all the way to webpage coding to complex algorithms. Anything resulting in the satisfactory arrangement of pixels on screens.

 There are more and better technologies coming together every day, so what should we build? Let the frontendery begin.
